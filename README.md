# Nixie Tube Clock ATEMEGA328P
This is a project I have been working on and wanted to share. All of the files are available for free. I have never had any elictrical engineering instructions and have had only minimal programming instruction. Please feel free to adapt this project as you like. The Gerber files for the boards can be found in the gerber directory, if you'd like to have boards made for yourself. Production and sale of this project is not permitted. Everything is free.

## Libraries Needed
RTC Library for using DS1307 with Arduino IDE<br/>

## Schematics
This project makes use of two separate boards to simplify the board manufactoring. The Control Board has the ATMEGA328P, the RTC, and all of the power circuits. The Tube Board has the Nixie Tubes, K155ID1 Tube Controllers, and the Shift Registers.
